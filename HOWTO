PREPARE nSKM(1-time modification)
---------------------------------------------------
Preparing your LSKUM Server:

	- See http://sites.google.com/site/jeromeboismartel/code-s-corner/ssh-key-management-with-skimp
	  for first steps
	- Create the directory '/etc/skm'
	- Create - as your WWW User(!) - a SSH key (it is recommended to encrypt it) and MOVE(!) the whole .ssh/ directory to /etc/skm/
	- Define a global (for all servers) nSKM sudo user account (this one is needed on every linux server and must not be 'root')
	- Edit MyFunctions.inc.php and change the sudousr variable to your global LSKUM user account you defined the step before:
		'$GLOBALS['sudousr'] = "ADDyourGLOBALsudoUSRNAMEhere";' --> '$GLOBALS['sudousr'] = "YOUR-SUDO-USR";'


PREPARE new host (1-time modification) 
---------------------------------------------------

	- SSH Login to the remote system with an administrative account
	- Create the nSKM sudousr you have defined
	- Put nSKM public key in .ssh/authorized_keys
